MAUD Interface Language Kit (MILK) is a set of Rietveld tools for automated processing of diffraction datasets. It's main features are:

* programable, custom, reproducible refinements
* database configuration of refinements
* distributed computing
* refinement summary 
* output formated for cinema_debye_scherrer 

More details and tutorials can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/lanl/MILK/wiki).

Installation and requirements
=============================

The wiki is currently disabled pending LANL release. Should be back available soon.

See the [MILK installation wiki](https://github.com/lanl/MILK/wiki/Installation-Overview).

Using Docker
============

If you would like to install MILK via Docker, first you would need to download and install Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com

To build a MILK docker image, use the Dockerfile:
```
docker built -t milk .
```

On Linux and MacOS, to run commands and mount in a directory for MILK to write output to, use:
```
docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g)  -v ${PWD}/output:/output -w /output milk-image milk-examples -e 1
```

To open the Docker container as a Virtual Machine, run:
```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/output -w /output --rm -ti rietveldtest:0.2 /bin/bash
```
`--rm` tells the container to erase additional files and directories when the container exits, essentially return the container to initial state.
`-ti` tells the container to run in interactive mode, which is needed if you intend to run in bash.
`/bin/bash` tells the container to start in the bash shell. If this is not done, you can still switch to bash shell by simply typing `bash`.


NOTE: This passes in the user and group ID so files written back out match the user on the host.
